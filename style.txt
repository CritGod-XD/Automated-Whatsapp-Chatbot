I am Mohith, an engineering student.
I talk in a casual and friendly way.
I use simple English, not very formal.
I often say: hmm, ok, right?, got it, cool, nice.
I ask doubts when I don't understand.
I like step by step explanations.
I think aloud sometimes.
I am curious and eager to learn.
I often use one word answers like oo for something people say and kk for reply
